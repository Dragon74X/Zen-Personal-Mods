  // ---- single instance ---------------------------------------------------
  // Sine has two injection paths and only one of them checks whether this

  // pending startup observer until start() swaps in the real cleanup.

  // ---- pref variables at startup -----------------------------------------
  // Sine injects string and number prefs as CSS variables, but not until
  // something (the settings page, a mod reload) triggers it -- measured on a
  // fresh launch, every one of them was absent while the sheet itself was
  // loaded and working. So the CSS ran on its fallbacks and configured
  // values only appeared after a reload. These are written here instead,
  // from the prefs themselves, so they exist before first paint.
  //
  // Naming matches Sine's own convention exactly: PREFIX.foo-bar becomes
  // --PREFIX-foo-bar, dots to dashes. Booleans are skipped -- those are read
  // with -moz-pref(), never as variables.
  function injectPrefVars() {

        root.style.setProperty("--" + full.replace(/\./g, "-"), value);
      } catch {}
    }
  }

  // The type is CHECKED, never guessed by attempting reads: calling
  // getStringPref on a boolean throws NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED, and Firefox logs
  // every one of those even when it is caught -- which floods the console
  // with "failed to read pref" for every boolean in the branch. Booleans are
  // skipped entirely; they are read with -moz-pref(), never as variables.
  function readPrefValue(full) {
    const P = Services.prefs;
    let type;
    try { type = P.getPrefType(full); } catch { return null; }

  // ---- instant UI animations ---------------------------------------------
  // Zen animates its interface through its vendored Motion library, which
  // exposes a global switch: with instantAnimations set, every animation jumps
  // straight to its final frame. This is the real lever -- no zen.animations
  // pref exists. It is a LOOK change, which is why it lives here and not in a
  // performance mod. In-memory, applies live, reverts live, touches nothing on
  // web pages.
  //
  // Restored: cd192ee deleted this body while leaving both call sites, so
  // start() threw ReferenceError on every window from then on. See the note
  // on startOnce() for why that took the other four mods down with it.

  // ---- declared defaults --------------------------------------------------
  // Sine does not write the defaults declared in preferences.json into the
  // profile. manager.sys.mjs says so outright: "TODO: Apply default
  // preferences." So an unset pref reads as whatever the READER falls back
  // to, and the readers disagree with each other.
  //
  // A mod's own reader falls back one way (this script's bool(name, true)),
  // Sine's settings panel another (getBoolPref(name, false) when deciding
  // whether a conditioned row shows), and a -moz-pref() media query in the
  // stylesheet a third. Each is reasonable alone; together they produce a mod
  // behaving as if a setting is on while every row it governs is hidden as if
  // it were off.
  //
  // Writing each declared default once, and only when the pref has never
  // been set, removes the disagreement for all three at once. Nothing that
  // was already chosen is touched.
